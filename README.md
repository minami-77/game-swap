# ðŸ“š Project Name
GameSwap is a rental platform where users can lend and borrow games from each other. Lenders can list their games, and borrowers can send rental requests. Once accepted, they can message each other through the app. The platform also allows borrowers to leave reviews after the rental is complete, promoting a trustworthy community.
